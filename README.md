# custom_linux_shell_C
This custom Linux shell in C supports executing commands, input/output redirection, piping, and built-in commands like cd and exit. It stores the last 50 commands in history, allowing users to view and rerun commands easily using !command_name. A practical project demonstrating process and input management.
